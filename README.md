# 📧 Spam Identifier 🚀  
A machine learning-based spam detection system that classifies emails as spam or not spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  

## 📌 Features  
✔️ Uses NLP techniques to process and analyze text  
✔️ Implements machine learning models for classification  
✔️ Supports dataset preprocessing and feature extraction  
✔️ Provides accuracy metrics for model evaluation  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, NLTK  
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building  

## 📂 Project Structure  
## 🚀 Installation & Setup  
1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
git clone https://github.com/luqmaanshaik/Spam-Identifier.git
cd Spam-Identifier

2️⃣ Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook


jupyter notebook
4️⃣ Open spam_identifier.ipynb and run the cells

📊 Dataset Information
Source: [Insert dataset source if available]
Contains: Emails labeled as spam or ham (not spam)
Features: Text preprocessing, vectorization (TF-IDF, CountVectorizer), and classification
📈 Model Performance
Algorithms Used: Naïve Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Expected Accuracy: ~95% (depends on dataset quality)
🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ Load and preprocess the dataset
2️⃣ Convert text data into numerical features
3️⃣ Train the model on labeled data
4️⃣ Predict whether new emails are spam or not

📝 Future Improvements
🔹 Deploy as a web application using Flask
